      <p>
        Hey, I’m a software engineer and data analyst who loves building
        creative solutions and telling stories through tech.
        <br /> Whether it’s developing intuitive web apps, fine-tuning smart
        contracts or translating languages with AI, I love using technology to
        make life smoother and smarter.
        <br />
        Outside of coding, you’ll find me exploring nature, being a foodie,
        journalling or planning my next big idea over a great playlist.
        <br />
        I'm passionate about making tech more accessible and empowering
        businesses with data-driven solutions.
        <br />
        Right now, I’m excited about growing into AI engineering and Data
        Analysis roles <br />
        while staying curious, creative and just a little bit obsessed with
        purple.
