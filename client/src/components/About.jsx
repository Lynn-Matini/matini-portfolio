        Hey, I’m a software engineer with passion for building creative
        solutions and telling stories through tech.
        <br />
        You’ll find me exploring the world of blockchain, dabbling in new AI
        projects or planning my next big idea over a good playlist.
        <br />
        I'm passionate about making tech more accessible and empowering
        businesses with data-driven solutions.
        <br />
        Right now, I’m excited about growing into AI engineering and Blockchain
        roles <br /> while staying curious, creative and just a little bit
        obsessed with purple.
